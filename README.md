NamChat is a very simple UDP chat application coded entirely on Java. This chat utilizes the classes DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket to allow for connections from multiple clients on to one main server.

Use ServerMain to start up a server at the default port of 8192.
Use Login to open the GUI to connect to a server:port.
